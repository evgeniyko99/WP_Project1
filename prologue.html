Welcome to the Kingdom of Damarel, where food is scarce and forest fires are abundant. Though, it was not always this way. The kingdom’s age of prosperity came to an abrupt end when the evil dragon Kazan awoke from his slumber. Many farming villages in the outskirts of the kingdom were razed to the earth as the dragon claims that as his territory. In response, the King has called upon any who is brave enough to eradicate the imminent threat.
<br>
You are Allard: an average male peasant who has no redeeming qualities, needless to say in combat. It’s obvious you're no match to the might of a dragon, but there may be another way…
